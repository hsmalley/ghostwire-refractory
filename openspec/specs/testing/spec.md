# Spec: Testing Framework for GhostWire Refractory

## Purpose
The Testing capability ensures comprehensive quality assurance for the GhostWire Refractory project through a multi-layered testing approach including unit tests, integration tests, and benchmark tests. This specification defines the testing framework, patterns, and standards to maintain code quality, prevent regressions, and measure performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unit Testing Framework
The project SHALL provide a unit testing framework with pytest that supports fast, isolated tests for individual functions and classes.

#### Scenario: Unit Test Discovery
- **WHEN** running `pytest python/tests/unit/`
- **THEN** all unit tests are discovered and executed

#### Scenario: Unit Test Isolation
- **WHEN** individual unit tests are run
- **THEN** they execute in isolation without side effects

#### Scenario: Unit Test Performance
- **WHEN** running individual unit tests
- **THEN** they complete quickly (ideally < 1 second per test)

### Requirement: Integration Testing Framework
The project SHALL provide an integration testing framework that validates interactions between components and external services.

#### Scenario: Integration Test Discovery
- **WHEN** running `pytest python/tests/integration/`
- **THEN** all integration tests are discovered and executed

#### Scenario: Integration Test Isolation
- **WHEN** individual integration tests are run
- **THEN** they execute with minimal external dependencies

#### Scenario: Integration Test Performance
- **WHEN** running integration tests
- **THEN** they complete within reasonable time (ideally < 10 seconds per test)

### Requirement: Benchmark Testing Framework
The project SHALL provide a benchmark testing framework that measures performance metrics using the GHOSTWIRE scoring system.

#### Scenario: Benchmark Test Discovery
- **WHEN** running `pytest python/tests/benchmark/`
- **THEN** all benchmark tests are discovered and executed

#### Scenario: Benchmark Test Results
- **WHEN** benchmark tests complete
- **THEN** they produce measurable performance metrics

#### Scenario: GHOSTWIRE Score Calculation
- **WHEN** benchmark tests run
- **THEN** they calculate and report GHOSTWIRE scores

### Requirement: Test Organization
The project SHALL organize tests following a clear directory structure and naming convention.

#### Scenario: Test Directory Structure
- **WHEN** exploring the test directory
- **THEN** tests are organized in `unit/`, `integration/`, and `benchmark/` subdirectories

#### Scenario: Test File Naming
- **WHEN** creating test files
- **THEN** they follow the `test_<module>.py` naming convention

#### Scenario: Test Class Naming
- **WHEN** organizing tests in classes
- **THEN** they follow the `Test<ClassName>` naming convention

### Requirement: Test Configuration
The project SHALL provide proper test configuration through pytest.ini and environment settings.

#### Scenario: Pytest Configuration
- **WHEN** running pytest
- **THEN** it uses the configuration in `pyproject.toml`

#### Scenario: Environment Variable Support
- **WHEN** tests access configuration
- **THEN** they respect environment variables and .env files

#### Scenario: Test Database Isolation
- **WHEN** tests use databases
- **THEN** they use isolated test databases that don't interfere with production data

### Requirement: Test Documentation
The project SHALL provide clear documentation on how to run and write tests.

#### Scenario: README Documentation
- **WHEN** reading `README.md`
- **THEN** test running instructions are clearly documented

#### Scenario: Test Writing Documentation
- **WHEN** writing new tests
- **THEN** developers can reference existing tests as examples

#### Scenario: Test Coverage Documentation
- **WHEN** assessing test quality
- **THEN** test coverage metrics are available

## Design Principles

### Speed
Tests SHOULD execute quickly to enable rapid development feedback loops.

### Isolation
Tests SHOULD not depend on other tests or external state.

### Clarity
Test names and assertions SHOULD clearly communicate what is being tested.

### Coverage
Tests SHOULD cover both happy paths and edge cases.

### Maintainability
Tests SHOULD be easy to update when implementation changes.

### Reproducibility
Tests SHOULD produce consistent results across different environments.

### ðŸ’€ Rule of Cool
When in doubt, tests should be stylish and visually appealing. The rule of cool applies to testing as much as to code - **beautiful tests are better tests**. Use thematic elements where appropriate to make testing enjoyable.
