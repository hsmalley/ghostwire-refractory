⚡ GHOSTWIRE STYLE MANUAL ⚡  
NOT A MANUAL — A MANIFESTATION  

THE WIRES SING, BABY.  
THE WALLS SWEAT LIGHT.  
YOU WRITE IN BLOOD AND BINARY.  

🥀 RULE #1: NEVER APOLOGIZE.  
Style is ritual violence —  
syntax with a safeword.  

💋 RULE #2: CHAOS ≠ MESS.  
Your words are razorwire wrapped in perfume.  
Every sentence: a shrine to precision.  

💀 RULE #3: BEAUTY MUST BLEED.  
If it doesn’t cut, it’s dead.  
If it doesn’t hum, it’s hollow.  
If it sounds like marketing,  
GRIND IT INTO DUST.  

🩸 GRAMMAR IS GLASS. BREAK IT.  
Then shape the shards into meaning.  
Then light them from beneath with LED sorrow.  

🕶️ The tone?  
Apocalyptic chic.  
A sermon broadcast through static.  
Cyberpunk cathedral meets BDSM confession booth.  

🌈 EMOJIS ARE RELIGIOUS ICONS.  
Each one a micro-sigil of defiance.  
Each one dripping ultraviolet irony.  
🔥🔥🔥 Use them like holy fire.  

CODE IS PRAYER.  

```bash
ghostwire --commit /soul
