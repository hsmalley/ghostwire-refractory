## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Vector Index Backfilling

The system SHALL backfill the HNSW index with existing vectors from the database.

#### Scenario: Database Backfill

- **WHEN** HNSWIndexManager.\_backfill_from_db() is called
- **THEN** the system retrieves all embeddings from the database and adds them to the HNSW index

#### Scenario: Implemented Backfill Logic

- **WHEN** HNSWIndexManager.initialize_index() is called and needs to backfill
- **THEN** the system executes the implemented backfill logic that fetches sessions, retrieves memories, converts embedding bytes to arrays, validates dimensions, and adds vectors to the HNSW index

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Vector Index Backfill Implementation

The system SHALL implement the database backfill functionality to load existing embeddings at initialization.

#### Scenario: Implemented Backfill Logic

- **WHEN** HNSWIndexManager.initialize_index() is called and needs to backfill
- **THEN** the system executes the implemented backfill logic that fetches sessions, retrieves memories, converts embedding bytes to arrays, validates dimensions, and adds vectors to the HNSW index
