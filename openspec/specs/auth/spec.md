# Authentication Capability Specification

## Purpose

The Authentication capability provides JWT-based authentication and authorization, including rate limiting and secure token management for the GhostWire Refractory system.

## Requirements

### Requirement: JWT Token Creation

The system SHALL create JWT access tokens for authenticated users.

#### Scenario: Token Creation

- **WHEN** AuthService.create_access_token() is called with user data
- **THEN** the system returns a signed JWT token that expires after the configured time

#### Scenario: Custom Expiration

- **WHEN** AuthService.create_access_token() is called with custom expiration
- **THEN** the system creates a token with the specified expiration time

#### Scenario: Default Expiration

- **WHEN** AuthService.create_access_token() is called without expiration
- **THEN** the system creates a token with the default configured expiration

### Requirement: JWT Token Verification

The system SHALL verify JWT tokens and return the payload for authenticated requests.

#### Scenario: Valid Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with a valid JWT token
- **THEN** the system returns the decoded payload

#### Scenario: Expired Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with an expired JWT token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

#### Scenario: Invalid Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with an invalid JWT token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

#### Scenario: Malformed Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with a malformed JWT token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

### Requirement: Password Hashing

The system SHALL securely hash passwords using bcrypt.

#### Scenario: Password Hashing

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_password_hash() is called with a plain password
- **THEN** the system returns a bcrypt hash of the password

### Requirement: Password Verification

The system SHALL verify plain passwords against hashed passwords.

#### Scenario: Password Verification Success

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_password() is called with matching plain and hashed passwords
- **THEN** the system returns true

#### Scenario: Password Verification Failure

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_password() is called with non-matching passwords
- **THEN** the system returns false

### Requirement: Rate Limiting

The system SHALL limit the number of requests per IP address within a time window.

#### Scenario: Within Rate Limit

- **WHEN** a client makes requests within the configured rate limit
- **THEN** the system processes the requests normally

#### Scenario: Rate Limit Exceeded

- **WHEN** a client exceeds the configured number of requests within the time window
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status

#### Scenario: Rate Limit Window Reset

- **WHEN** the time window elapses after requests were made
- **THEN** the system resets the request count for that client

#### Scenario: Multiple Clients Rate Limiting

- **WHEN** multiple clients access the system simultaneously
- **THEN** the system maintains separate rate limits for each client IP

### Requirement: Current User Retrieval

The system SHALL provide a method to get the current authenticated user from the token.

#### Scenario: Valid User Retrieval

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_current_user() is called with a valid token
- **THEN** the system returns the user ID from the token payload

#### Scenario: Invalid User Retrieval

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_current_user() is called with an invalid token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

#### Scenario: Missing User in Token

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_current_user() is called with a token lacking user ID
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

### Requirement: Middleware Integration

The system SHALL integrate authentication and rate limiting as middleware in the API.

#### Scenario: Authentication Middleware

- **WHEN** requests require authentication
- **THEN** the system applies JWT verification before processing the request

#### Scenario: Rate Limiting Middleware

- **WHEN** requests are made to the API
- **THEN** the system checks rate limits before processing the request

### Requirement: Security Configuration

The system SHALL support configurable security parameters.

#### Scenario: Custom JWT Algorithm

- **WHEN** the system initializes with JWT_ALGORITHM configuration
- **THEN** the system uses the specified algorithm for token encoding/decoding

#### Scenario: Custom Secret Key

- **WHEN** the system initializes with SECRET_KEY configuration
- **THEN** the system uses the specified key for token signing

#### Scenario: Custom Token Expiration

- **WHEN** the system initializes with ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES configuration
- **THEN** the system uses the specified time for token expiration

### Requirement: Error Response Format

The system SHALL return consistent error responses for authentication failures.

#### Scenario: Unauthorized Error Response

- **WHEN** authentication fails
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 401 with proper error details in WWW-Authenticate header

#### Scenario: Rate Limit Error Response

- **WHEN** rate limit is exceeded
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 with appropriate error message

### Requirement: JWT Token Verification

The system SHALL verify JWT tokens and return the payload for authenticated requests.

#### Scenario: Valid Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with a valid JWT token
- **THEN** the system returns the decoded payload

#### Scenario: Expired Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with an expired JWT token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

#### Scenario: Invalid Token Verification

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_token() is called with an invalid JWT token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401

### Requirement: Password Hashing

The system SHALL securely hash passwords using bcrypt.

#### Scenario: Password Hashing

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_password_hash() is called with a plain password
- **THEN** the system returns a bcrypt hash of the password

### Requirement: Password Verification

The system SHALL verify plain passwords against hashed passwords.

#### Scenario: Password Verification Success

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_password() is called with matching plain and hashed passwords
- **THEN** the system returns true

#### Scenario: Password Verification Failure

- **WHEN** AuthService.verify_password() is called with non-matching passwords
- **THEN** the system returns false

### Requirement: Rate Limiting

The system SHALL limit the number of requests per IP address within a time window.

#### Scenario: Within Rate Limit

- **WHEN** a client makes requests within the configured rate limit
- **THEN** the system processes the requests normally

#### Scenario: Rate Limit Exceeded

- **WHEN** a client exceeds the configured number of requests within the time window
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status

### Requirement: Current User Retrieval

The system SHALL provide a method to get the current authenticated user from the token.

#### Scenario: Valid User Retrieval

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_current_user() is called with a valid token
- **THEN** the system returns the user ID from the token payload

#### Scenario: Invalid User Retrieval

- **WHEN** AuthService.get_current_user() is called with an invalid token
- **THEN** the system raises an HTTPException with status code 401
