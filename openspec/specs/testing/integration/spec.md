# Spec: Integration Testing Framework

## Purpose
The Integration Testing Framework capability validates interactions between components and external services in the GhostWire Refractory project. These tests ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly and that external service integrations function as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Integration Test Structure
Integration tests SHALL follow a clear structure using pytest conventions with appropriate markers.

#### Scenario: Test File Structure
- **WHEN** creating a new integration test file
- **THEN** it follows the `test_<module>.py` naming convention and is placed in `python/tests/integration/`

#### Scenario: Test Class Structure
- **WHEN** organizing integration tests in classes
- **THEN** they use the `Test<ClassName>` naming convention and may inherit from `unittest.TestCase` or use pytest fixtures

#### Scenario: Test Method Structure
- **WHEN** writing integration test methods
- **THEN** they use the `test_<functionality>` naming convention and follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

#### Scenario: Test Marker Usage
- **WHEN** running integration tests
- **THEN** they are marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` for proper categorization

### Requirement: Integration Test Dependencies
Integration tests SHALL manage external dependencies appropriately.

#### Scenario: Database Integration
- **WHEN** testing database interactions
- **THEN** they use temporary or test databases that don't interfere with production data

#### Scenario: API Integration
- **WHEN** testing API endpoints
- **THEN** they use the TestClient from fastapi to make requests without requiring a live server

#### Scenario: External Service Integration
- **WHEN** testing external service interactions
- **THEN** they use mocking or test instances where possible

#### Scenario: Environment Variable Handling
- **WHEN** integration tests access configuration
- **THEN** they respect environment variables and .env files

### Requirement: Integration Test Performance
Integration tests SHALL execute within reasonable time constraints.

#### Scenario: Test Execution Time
- **WHEN** running individual integration tests
- **THEN** they complete in < 10 seconds under normal conditions

#### Scenario: Concurrent Test Execution
- **WHEN** running integration tests in parallel
- **THEN** they utilize available resources without conflicts

#### Scenario: Resource Cleanup
- **WHEN** integration tests complete
- **THEN** they properly clean up any resources they created

### Requirement: Integration Test Coverage
Integration tests SHALL validate component interactions and external service integrations.

#### Scenario: API Endpoint Coverage
- **WHEN** testing API endpoints
- **THEN** they validate request/response handling, error conditions, and authentication

#### Scenario: Database Operation Coverage
- **WHEN** testing database operations
- **THEN** they validate CRUD operations, transactions, and data integrity

#### Scenario: Service Integration Coverage
- **WHEN** testing service integrations
- **THEN** they validate data flow between services and error propagation

#### Scenario: External API Coverage
- **WHEN** testing external API integrations
- **THEN** they validate request formation, response parsing, and error handling

### Requirement: Integration Test Isolation
Integration tests SHALL maintain appropriate isolation between tests.

#### Scenario: Database Isolation
- **WHEN** running multiple database integration tests
- **THEN** they use separate databases or transactions to avoid interference

#### Scenario: API Isolation
- **WHEN** running multiple API integration tests
- **THEN** they don't share state between tests unless explicitly required

#### Scenario: External Service Isolation
- **WHEN** testing external services
- **THEN** they use unique identifiers or mock responses to avoid conflicts

### Requirement: Integration Test Documentation
Integration tests SHALL be well-documented and self-explanatory.

#### Scenario: Test Description
- **WHEN** reading integration test names
- **THEN** they clearly describe what is being tested

#### Scenario: Test Setup Documentation
- **WHEN** understanding test prerequisites
- **THEN** setup requirements are clearly documented in docstrings

#### Scenario: Test Assertion Documentation
- **WHEN** understanding test expectations
- **THEN** assertions are clearly explained

### Requirement: Integration Test Configuration
Integration tests SHALL be configurable and environment-aware.

#### Scenario: Configuration Flexibility
- **WHEN** running integration tests in different environments
- **THEN** they adapt to environment-specific settings

#### Scenario: Test Database Configuration
- **WHEN** integration tests use databases
- **THEN** they respect `DB_PATH` and other database configuration settings

#### Scenario: Service Endpoint Configuration
- **WHEN** integration tests interact with external services
- **THEN** they respect service endpoint configuration from settings

## Design Principles

### Scope
Integration tests SHOULD focus on component interactions rather than implementation details.

### Speed
Integration tests SHOULD execute reasonably quickly while testing realistic scenarios.

### Reliability
Integration tests SHOULD produce consistent results and handle transient failures gracefully.

### Maintainability
Integration tests SHOULD be easy to update when interfaces change.

### Realism
Integration tests SHOULD use realistic data and scenarios that reflect actual usage.

### Isolation
Integration tests SHOULD minimize dependencies and interference between tests.

### ðŸ’€ Rule of Cool
Integration tests SHOULD embody the GhostWire aesthetic with thematic variable names and descriptive language. Use cyberpunk metaphors when appropriate to make tests memorable and engaging. Remember - even tests can bleed neon!
