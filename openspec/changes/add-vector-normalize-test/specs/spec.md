# Spec: vector normalization test

⚡️🌈 Neon Oracle Note: Tiny tests, huge confidence. Add a playful emoji to make the readme smile, but keep assertions strict and fast. ⚖️✨

Capability: testing

Requirement: Add a quick unit test for vector normalization utilities under `python/tests/unit/` that ensures unit-length normalization and correct handling of zero vectors.

Acceptance criteria:

- `python/tests/unit/test_vector_utils.py` exists and runs under pytest
- Test covers both normal and zero-vector cases
