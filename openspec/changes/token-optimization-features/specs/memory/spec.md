## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Document Storage Capability

The system SHALL provide functionality to store user documents (e.g., code) in the vector database.

#### Scenario: Document Upload

- **WHEN** a user uploads a document through the document storage API
- **THEN** the system chunks the document and stores it in the memory database with embeddings

#### Scenario: Document Retrieval

- **WHEN** a user requests to retrieve stored documents
- **THEN** the system returns the stored documents with their metadata

### Requirement: Enhanced Token Buffering

The system SHALL implement intelligent caching of embedding comparisons to minimize remote LLM token usage.

#### Scenario: Cached Response Retrieval

- **WHEN** a user query is similar to a previously processed query
- **THEN** the system returns the cached response without making a remote LLM call
