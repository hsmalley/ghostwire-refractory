# Database Capability Specification

## Purpose

The Database capability manages SQLite connection pooling and data access operations for the GhostWire Refractory system, providing efficient and thread-safe database interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Connection Pool Management

The system SHALL maintain a pool of SQLite connections for efficient resource utilization.

### Requirement: Memory Text Operations

The system SHALL provide CRUD operations for memory text entries in the database.

#### Scenario: Create Memory Entry

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.create_memory() is called
- **THEN** the system stores the memory with its embedding in the database

#### Scenario: Retrieve Memories by Session

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.get_memories_by_session() is called with session ID
- **THEN** the system returns memories for that session ordered by timestamp

#### Scenario: Query Similar Memories

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.query_similar_by_embedding() is called with an embedding
- **THEN** the system calculates cosine similarity with stored embeddings and returns the most similar results

#### Scenario: Memory Retrieval with Limit

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.get_memories_by_session() is called with limit
- **THEN** the system returns at most the specified number of memories

### Requirement: Session-Based Operations

The system SHALL support database operations filtered by session ID.

#### Scenario: Get Memories by Session

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.get_memories_by_session() is called with a session ID
- **THEN** the system returns only memories belonging to that session

### Requirement: Collection Management

The system SHALL support operations on memory collections (sessions) including creation, deletion, and size queries.

#### Scenario: Collection Deletion

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.delete_collection() is called with a collection name
- **THEN** the system removes all memories in that collection

#### Scenario: Collection Existence Check

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.collection_exists() is called with a collection name
- **THEN** the system returns whether that collection contains memories

#### Scenario: Check Dropped Collections

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.collection_exists() is called with a previously dropped collection name
- **THEN** the system returns false indicating the collection does not exist

#### Scenario: Get Collection Size

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.get_collection_size() is called with a collection name
- **THEN** the system returns the number of memories in that collection

### Requirement: Connection Cleanup

The system SHALL properly close all database connections during shutdown.

#### Scenario: System Shutdown

- **WHEN** the application shuts down
- **THEN** the system closes all database connections in the pool

#### Scenario: Connection Return to Pool

- **WHEN** database operations complete
- **THEN** the system returns the connection to the pool for reuse

### Requirement: Database Transaction Management

The system SHALL support database transactions for atomic operations.

#### Scenario: Transaction Commit

- **WHEN** database operations complete successfully within a transaction
- **THEN** the system commits the transaction to persist changes

#### Scenario: Transaction Rollback

- **WHEN** database operations fail within a transaction
- **THEN** the system rolls back the transaction to maintain data integrity

### Requirement: Database Configuration

The system SHALL support configurable database parameters.

#### Scenario: Custom Database Path

- **WHEN** the system initializes with DB_PATH configuration
- **THEN** the system uses the specified path for the SQLite database

#### Scenario: Connection Pool Size Configuration

- **WHEN** the system initializes with DB_POOL_SIZE configuration
- **THEN** the system creates the connection pool with the specified size

#### Scenario: Connection Pool Overflow Configuration

- **WHEN** the system initializes with DB_POOL_OVERFLOW configuration
- **THEN** the system allows the specified overflow connections when needed

### Requirement: Database Optimization

The system SHALL configure SQLite for optimal performance.

#### Scenario: WAL Mode Configuration

- **WHEN** the system creates database connections
- **THEN** the system enables WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency

#### Scenario: Synchronous Mode Configuration

- **WHEN** the system creates database connections
- **THEN** the system sets appropriate synchronous mode for performance

#### Scenario: Cache Size Configuration

- **WHEN** the system creates database connections
- **THEN** the system configures appropriate cache size for better performance

#### Scenario: Temp Store Configuration

- **WHEN** the system creates database connections
- **THEN** the system configures temp store to memory for better performance

### Requirement: Row Access by Name

The system SHALL provide access to query results by column name.

#### Scenario: Column Access by Name

- **WHEN** database queries return results
- **THEN** the system allows accessing columns by name rather than position only

### Requirement: Memory Data Persistence

The system SHALL properly serialize and deserialize memory data.

#### Scenario: Embedding Serialization

- **WHEN** MemoryRepository.create_memory() stores embeddings
