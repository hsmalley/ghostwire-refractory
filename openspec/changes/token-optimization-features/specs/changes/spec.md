- **WHEN** the token caching layer is implemented with similarity thresholds
- **THEN** the system reduces redundant processing by caching similar queries

### Requirement: Intelligent Caching in RAG Service

The system SHALL implement intelligent caching in the RAG service to further reduce token usage.

#### Scenario: Intelligent Caching Implementation

- **WHEN** intelligent caching is implemented in the RAG service
- **THEN** the system further reduces token usage through enhanced caching strategies

### Requirement: Document Ingestion and Chunking Service

The system SHALL create a document ingestion and chunking service to process user documents.

#### Scenario: Document Ingestion Implementation

- **WHEN** the document ingestion and chunking service is created
- **THEN** the system can process user documents (e.g., code) for storage

### Requirement: Document Parsing for Various Formats

The system SHALL implement document parsing for various formats including text, code, and markup.

#### Scenario: Document Parsing Implementation

- **WHEN** document parsing is implemented for various formats
- **THEN** the system can process different document types with appropriate parsing logic

### Requirement: Document Upload API Endpoints
