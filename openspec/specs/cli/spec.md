# CLI Capability Specification

## Purpose
The CLI capability provides command-line interface functionality for the GhostWire Refractory system, enabling easy startup and management of the service.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Application Entry Point
The system SHALL provide a command-line entry point for starting the GhostWire Refractory service.

#### Scenario: CLI Service Start
- **WHEN** the `ghostwire` command is executed
- **THEN** the system starts the FastAPI application with configured settings

#### Scenario: CLI Entry Point Configuration
- **WHEN** the system is installed with pip install -e .
- **THEN** the ghostwire command is available in the user's PATH

### Requirement: Configuration via CLI
The system SHALL respect configuration settings when started via CLI.

#### Scenario: CLI Configuration Override
- **WHEN** the service is started with environment variables
- **THEN** the system uses the environment-provided configuration values

#### Scenario: Default Configuration Loading
- **WHEN** the service is started without explicit configuration
- **THEN** the system loads default configuration values

### Requirement: Server Startup
The system SHALL initialize all required components when started via CLI.

#### Scenario: Component Initialization
- **WHEN** the ghostwire command starts the service
- **THEN** the system initializes HNSW index, database connections, and loads settings

#### Scenario: HNSW Index Initialization
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI
- **THEN** the system initializes the HNSW index and backfills with existing data if needed

#### Scenario: Database Pool Initialization
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI
- **THEN** the system initializes the database connection pool

### Requirement: Server Configuration
The system SHALL apply configuration settings when starting the service.

#### Scenario: Host Configuration
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI
- **THEN** the system binds to the configured HOST address

#### Scenario: Port Configuration
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI
- **THEN** the system binds to the configured PORT

#### Scenario: Debug Mode Configuration
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI with DEBUG enabled
- **THEN** the system enables debug features like auto-reload

### Requirement: Process Lifecycle Management
The system SHALL properly handle startup and shutdown events.

#### Scenario: Startup Event Handling
- **WHEN** the service starts via CLI
- **THEN** the system executes startup event handlers including HNSW initialization

#### Scenario: Shutdown Event Handling
- **WHEN** the service receives a shutdown signal
- **THEN** the system executes shutdown event handlers including index saving and connection cleanup

#### Scenario: Cleanup on Exit
- **WHEN** the CLI process exits
- **THEN** the system saves the HNSW index and closes all database connections

### Requirement: Configuration via CLI
The system SHALL respect configuration settings when started via CLI.

#### Scenario: CLI Configuration Override
- **WHEN** the service is started with environment variables
- **THEN** the system uses the environment-provided configuration values
