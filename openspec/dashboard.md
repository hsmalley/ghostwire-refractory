# GhostWire Refractory - OpenSpec Dashboard

## Project Overview

A neural network-based chat system with memory that stores message embeddings in SQLite and uses HNSW for efficient vector similarity search, with a distinctive cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Theme

See `openspec/THEME.md` for repository-wide style and tone guidance.

## Current Status

- **System Implemented**: âœ… Core functionality complete
- **Code Cleanup**: âœ… Completed (archived: cleanup-unused-code-2025-10-14)
- **Spec Documentation**: âœ… All capabilities documented with comprehensive requirements (155 total)
- **Token Optimization**: ðŸ”„ In planning phase (token-optimization-features)

## Active Changes

- `token-optimization-features`: Implement token optimization, document storage, and Qdrant compatibility
  - 0/13 tasks completed
  - Priority: High (based on GHOSTWIRE_GOALS.md)
- `add-openspec-orchestrator`: Multi-LLM orchestration with Master/Worker pattern
  - 11/13 tasks completed
  - Priority: Medium (enhancement to existing functionality)

- Embedding validation and normalization
- Repository pattern for database operations

### âœ… Models (20 requirements)

- Pydantic data models for all components
- Validation and serialization
- Request/response models
- Session ID validation

### âœ… Utilities (10 requirements)

- Input validation, sanitization, error handling

- Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- Error conversion utilities

### âœ… Vector (17 requirements)

- HNSW index management with backfill functionality
- Vector operations and persistence
- Thread-safe operations
- Configuration parameters

### âœ… Orchestrator (6 requirements)

- Multi-LLM coordination with Master/Worker pattern
- Task decomposition and distribution
- Permission management for orchestrated tasks
- Safe code patching capabilities
- Integration with benchmarking and GHOSTWIRE scoring

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of token optimization features
2. Implement document storage capability
3. Create Qdrant-compatible endpoints
4. Enhance summarization for token reduction
5. Optimize remote LLM interactions

## Technical Debt

- HNSW library does not support vector deletion (workaround needed)
- Single-server deployment (horizontal scaling possible)

## Completed Enhancements

- Comprehensive requirements for all capabilities (155 total)
- Detailed scenario definitions for all requirements
- Error handling and validation requirements
- Configuration and security requirements
- All specs now properly formatted and validated by OpenSpec tool
