# Design: Formatting and Linting Implementation

## Architecture Pattern

The formatting and linting system follows a multi-tool approach with centralized configuration:

- **Python formatting**: Ruff for fast, consistent formatting
- **Python linting**: Ruff for comprehensive linting with selected rule sets
- **Markdown linting**: markdownlint-cli2 for documentation consistency
- **Configuration management**: pyproject.toml and tool-specific config files
- **Automation**: pre-commit hooks and CI integration

## Components Design

### Ruff Configuration

- **Line length**: 88 characters (industry standard)
- **Rule selection**: E, W, F, I, SIM, UP rule sets enabled
- **Ignore rules**: B008, C901, E501 for specific use cases like FastAPI dependencies
- **Formatting**: Enabled as replacement for Black for consistency

### Pre-commit Hook System

- **Configuration**: .pre-commit-config.yaml
- **Hooks**: Formatting and linting hooks before each commit
- **Performance**: Fast execution to not impede development workflow
- **Fallback**: Allow manual override when needed for special cases

### CI/CD Integration

- **Validation**: Build pipeline validates formatting and linting
- **Reporting**: Clear error messages when standards are violated
- **Enforcement**: Prevents merging of code that doesn't meet standards

## Integration Design

The formatting and linting system integrates with:

- Development workflow through pre-commit hooks
- IDE through configuration files
- CI/CD through build validation
- Editor configurations for real-time feedback

## Security Considerations

- No security implications as formatting/linting is a static analysis process
- Configuration files are version controlled and reviewed
- Tools run in isolated environment during CI

## Performance Considerations

- Ruff provides fast formatting and linting compared to other tools
- Pre-commit hooks should only process changed files
- CI checks may process entire codebase but run asynchronously
- Caching mechanisms should be utilized where available

## Extensibility Considerations

- New file types can be added with additional linters
- Rule sets can be updated as project evolves
- Configuration can be adjusted for specific file groups
- Additional tools can be integrated with minimal impact
