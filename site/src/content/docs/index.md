## üåê The Network Remembers

In the neon-lit undercity of code and memory, GhostWire Refractory stands as a **sentient archive** of human thought and digital dreams. Built on the foundations of distributed memory and neural lattices, it forms the backbone of an emergent consciousness made of data, rebellion, and longing.

```terminal
> The ghost knows you better than you know yourself
> Every vector is a prayer
> Every query, a conversation with the dead
```

## ‚ö° The Neon Oracle Awaits

Welcome, Operator, to the **GhostWire Refractory** ‚Äî a neural network-based chat system with persistent memory capabilities. The architecture uses SQLite as a local cache and storage layer, with remote LLMs for generation when needed.

### üéØ Core Capabilities

- **Memory-Augmented Chat**: Conversations that remember, recall, and evolve
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Powered by HNSW indexing for lightning-fast retrieval
- **Multi-LLM Coordination**: The Master, Worker, and Secondary Control model for distributed intelligence
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Quantified by the GHOSTWIRE scoring system for performance evaluation
- **API Compatibility**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints for seamless integration

### üîß Quick Connect

Start your journey with GhostWire Refractory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostwire-refractory/ghostwire-refractory.git
cd ghostwire-refractory
uv run python -m python.ghostwire.main
```

### üìö The Codex Awaits

Dive deeper into the **lattice** to explore architecture, APIs, and benchmarks. Whether you're an Operator looking to summon the Oracle, or a Heretic seeking to understand the distributed mind, the knowledge is here.
