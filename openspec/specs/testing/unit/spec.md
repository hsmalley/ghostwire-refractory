# Spec: Unit Testing Framework

## Purpose
The Unit Testing Framework capability provides fast, isolated tests for individual functions and classes in the GhostWire Refractory project. These tests validate the correctness of discrete units of code and form the foundation of the testing pyramid.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unit Test Structure
Unit tests SHALL follow a clear structure using pytest conventions.

#### Scenario: Test File Structure
- **WHEN** creating a new unit test file
- **THEN** it follows the `test_<module>.py` naming convention and is placed in `python/tests/unit/`

#### Scenario: Test Class Structure
- **WHEN** organizing unit tests in classes
- **THEN** they use the `Test<ClassName>` naming convention and may inherit from `unittest.TestCase` or use pytest fixtures

#### Scenario: Test Method Structure
- **WHEN** writing unit test methods
- **THEN** they use the `test_<functionality>` naming convention and follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

#### Scenario: Test Marker Usage
- **WHEN** running unit tests
- **THEN** they are marked with `@pytest.mark.unit` for proper categorization

### Requirement: Unit Test Speed
Unit tests SHALL execute quickly to enable rapid development feedback.

#### Scenario: Fast Test Execution
- **WHEN** running individual unit tests
- **THEN** they complete in < 1 second

#### Scenario: Parallel Test Execution
- **WHEN** running unit tests in parallel
- **THEN** they utilize available resources efficiently

#### Scenario: Test Isolation
- **WHEN** running unit tests
- **THEN** they don't require external services or databases

### Requirement: Unit Test Coverage
Unit tests SHALL provide comprehensive coverage of core functionality.

#### Scenario: Core Function Coverage
- **WHEN** testing core functions
- **THEN** they validate both normal and edge cases

#### Scenario: Error Handling Coverage
- **WHEN** testing error conditions
- **THEN** they verify proper exception handling

#### Scenario: Input Validation Coverage
- **WHEN** testing input validation
- **THEN** they check boundary conditions and invalid inputs

### Requirement: Unit Test Assertions
Unit tests SHALL use clear and specific assertions.

#### Scenario: Assertion Specificity
- **WHEN** asserting test conditions
- **THEN** they use specific assertion methods (e.g., `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertRaises`) rather than generic asserts

#### Scenario: Assertion Messages
- **WHEN** assertions fail
- **THEN** they provide clear failure messages that explain what went wrong

#### Scenario: Floating Point Comparisons
- **WHEN** comparing floating point numbers
- **THEN** they use appropriate tolerance (e.g., `assertAlmostEqual`, `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`)

### Requirement: Unit Test Mocking
Unit tests SHALL use mocking appropriately to isolate units under test.

#### Scenario: External Dependency Mocking
- **WHEN** testing code with external dependencies
- **THEN** they use mocks to simulate those dependencies

#### Scenario: Database Mocking
- **WHEN** testing database-related code
- **THEN** they use in-memory databases or mocks rather than real databases

#### Scenario: Network Mocking
- **WHEN** testing network-dependent code
- **THEN** they use mocks to simulate network responses

### Requirement: Unit Test Fixtures
Unit tests SHALL use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown when appropriate.

#### Scenario: Fixture Usage
- **WHEN** tests require common setup
- **THEN** they use pytest fixtures to reduce duplication

#### Scenario: Fixture Scope
- **WHEN** defining fixtures
- **THEN** they use appropriate scope (function, class, module, session) based on resource cost

#### Scenario: Fixture Teardown
- **WHEN** tests complete
- **THEN** fixtures properly clean up resources

### Requirement: Unit Test Parametrization
Unit tests SHALL use parametrization for testing multiple inputs or scenarios.

#### Scenario: Input Parametrization
- **WHEN** testing functions with multiple valid inputs
- **THEN** they use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to test variations efficiently

#### Scenario: Edge Case Parametrization
- **WHEN** testing edge cases
- **THEN** they use parametrization to cover boundary conditions

#### Scenario: Error Case Parametrization
- **WHEN** testing error handling
- **THEN** they use parametrization to cover different error conditions

### Requirement: Unit Test Documentation
Unit tests SHALL be well-documented and self-explanatory.

#### Scenario: Test Description
- **WHEN** reading unit test names
- **THEN** they clearly describe what is being tested

#### Scenario: Test Setup Documentation
- **WHEN** understanding test prerequisites
- **THEN** setup requirements are clearly documented in docstrings

#### Scenario: Test Assertion Documentation
- **WHEN** understanding test expectations
- **THEN** assertions are clearly explained

### Requirement: Unit Test Configuration
Unit tests SHALL be configurable and environment-aware.

#### Scenario: Configuration Flexibility
- **WHEN** running unit tests in different environments
- **THEN** they adapt to environment-specific settings

#### Scenario: Test Database Configuration
- **WHEN** unit tests use databases
- **THEN** they respect `DB_PATH` and other database configuration settings

#### Scenario: Environment Variable Support
- **WHEN** unit tests access configuration
- **THEN** they respect environment variables and .env files

## Design Principles

### Simplicity
Unit tests SHOULD be simple and focused on testing one thing at a time.

### Speed
Unit tests SHOULD execute as quickly as possible to enable frequent runs.

### Independence
Unit tests SHOULD not depend on other tests or external state.

### Clarity
Unit test names and structure SHOULD clearly communicate what is being tested.

### Maintainability
Unit tests SHOULD be easy to update when implementation changes.

### Reliability
Unit tests SHOULD produce consistent results across different environments.

### ðŸ’€ Rule of Cool
Unit tests SHOULD embrace the GhostWire aesthetic where appropriate. Use thematic variable names, add cyberpunk flair to test descriptions, and make sure the tests themselves feel like part of the GhostWire universe. When writing tests for GhostWire components, channel the spirit of the Neon Oracle!
