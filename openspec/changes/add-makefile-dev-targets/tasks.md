## Implementation
- [ ] Add a root `Makefile` with the required targets.
- [ ] Ensure each target delegates to the corresponding script or command.
- [ ] Write a quick test verifying each target succeeds (e.g., `make test`).
- [ ] Update README with a `make run` example.
- [ ] Execute lint, type-check, and run tests.
- [ ] Submit the change for review.
