# Design: Testing Framework Implementation

## Architecture Pattern
The testing framework follows a layered approach with three distinct test categories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Fast, isolated tests for individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests** - Tests for component interactions and external service integrations
3. **Benchmark Tests** - Performance measurements using the GHOSTWIRE scoring system

## Components Design

### Pytest Configuration
- **Framework**: Pytest as the primary test runner
- **Markers**: Custom markers for categorizing tests (unit, integration, benchmark)
- **Configuration**: pyproject.toml with appropriate test discovery and execution settings
- **Plugins**: pytest-asyncio for async tests, pytest-cov for coverage reporting

### Test Organization
- **Directory Structure**: Separate directories for unit, integration, and benchmark tests
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<module>.py` for test files, `Test<ClassName>` for test classes
- **File Structure**: Clear separation of test concerns with appropriate imports

### Test Fixtures
- **Database Fixtures**: Temporary databases for isolated testing
- **API Fixtures**: TestClient for API endpoint testing
- **Service Fixtures**: Mocked services for unit testing
- **Configuration Fixtures**: Environment-aware settings for consistent testing

## Integration Design

The testing framework integrates with:
- **Configuration System**: Respects settings from environment variables and .env files
- **Database Layer**: Uses temporary databases for isolation
- **API Layer**: Uses TestClient for endpoint testing
- **Service Layer**: Provides mocks for external service dependencies

## Security Considerations

- **Isolation**: Tests use isolated databases to prevent data contamination
- **Permissions**: Tests run with minimal required permissions
- **Environment**: Tests respect environment-specific configurations

## Performance Considerations

- **Speed**: Unit tests execute quickly (< 1 second each)
- **Parallelization**: Tests can run in parallel for faster execution
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of test resources
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory usage during test execution

## Extensibility Considerations

- **New Test Categories**: Easy to add new test types with appropriate markers
- **Custom Fixtures**: Simple to create new fixtures for specific testing needs
- **Reporting**: Flexible reporting mechanisms for different test categories
- **Configuration**: Extensible configuration through environment variables

### ðŸ’€ Rule of Cool
The testing framework embraces the GhostWire aesthetic:
- **Thematic variable names** that reflect the cyberpunk theme
- **Visually appealing test output** with appropriate emoji and formatting
- **Descriptive test names** that read like cyberpunk mission briefings
- **Maintainable structure** that doesn't sacrifice style for functionality
