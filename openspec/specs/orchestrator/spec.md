# Orchestrator Capability Specification

## Purpose
The Orchestrator capability provides multi-LLM coordination using the Master, Worker, and Secondary Control model for the GhostWire Refractory system, enabling distributed task processing, permission management, and safe code modifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Master Component Operation
The system SHALL coordinate multiple LLM clients to process user requests through decomposition and aggregation.

#### Scenario: Request Processing
- **WHEN** GhostWireOrchestrator.process_request() is called with a user request
- **THEN** the system decomposes the request, distributes subtasks, and returns a compiled response

#### Scenario: Task Distribution
- **WHEN** the Master component receives decomposed subtasks
- **THEN** the system distributes tasks among available LLM clients based on task type

### Requirement: LLM Client Management
The system SHALL manage multiple LLM clients with different endpoints and capabilities.

#### Scenario: Client Task Execution
- **WHEN** an LLM client receives a task
- **THEN** the system executes the appropriate operation (chat, embed, summarize) and returns results

#### Scenario: Endpoint Management
- **WHEN** multiple LLM endpoints are configured
- **THEN** the system distributes tasks appropriately across endpoints

### Requirement: Task Decomposition
The system SHALL decompose complex user requests into distributable subtasks.

#### Scenario: Request Analysis
- **WHEN** decompose_user_request() is called with a user request
- **THEN** the system identifies different operation types and creates appropriate subtasks

#### Scenario: Task Type Handling
- **WHEN** a request contains multiple operation types
- **THEN** the system creates specific subtasks for each operation type (chat, embed, summarize, etc.)

### Requirement: Permission Validation
The system SHALL validate permissions for each task before execution.

#### Scenario: Permission Check
- **WHEN** a task is submitted for execution
- **THEN** the system validates appropriate permissions based on task type and user context

#### Scenario: Session Management
- **WHEN** a user session is created
- **THEN** the system assigns appropriate permission levels and creates time-limited tokens

### Requirement: Safe Code Patching
The system SHALL provide safe mechanisms for applying code modifications.

#### Scenario: Patch Validation
- **WHEN** a code patch is submitted
- **THEN** the system validates safety before application

#### Scenario: Patch Application
- **WHEN** a validated patch is applied
- **THEN** the system creates backups and applies changes safely

### Requirement: Benchmark Integration
The system SHALL integrate with the existing benchmarking system for multi-LLM evaluation.

#### Scenario: Distributed Benchmarking
- **WHEN** run_benchmark_task() is called through the orchestrator
- **THEN** the system distributes the benchmark across multiple LLM clients and calculates GHOSTWIRE scores

#### Scenario: GHOSTWIRE Score Calculation
- **WHEN** benchmark results are aggregated
- **THEN** the system calculates appropriate GHOSTWIRE scores based on benchmark type
