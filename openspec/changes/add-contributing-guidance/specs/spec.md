# Spec: CONTRIBUTING.md with theme guidance and opt-outs

Capability: docs

Requirement: Add a short, focused `CONTRIBUTING.md` at repository root that documents the project's thematic flavor (neon/cyberpunk, Neon Oracle voice), clarifies where to use flamboyant flavor text vs. neutral, public-facing documentation, and provides simple opt-outs (emoji/ANSI logging, metaphors) plus a straightforward "how to run" section for contributors who don't use the repo's `uv` helper.

Acceptance criteria:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` present at repository root
- Contains: Purpose, Where to use the flavor, When to avoid it, Emoji/log opt-out example, Simple run instructions, Links to `GHOSTWIRE_GPT/*` theme files and `AGENTS.md`
- README contains a one-line pointer under Development Setup linking to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
