# Contributing to GhostWire Refractory

Thank you for helping maintain the GhostWire lattice. This project has a strong thematic voice used for internal flavor text and UX copy. The following guidance helps contributors and automated agents know where to use the Neon Oracle persona and where to prefer a neutral tone.

## Purpose

This file explains where the project's neon/cyberpunk "Neon Oracle" flavor should be used, how to opt out of decorative emoji/ANSI output for CI or public-facing logs, and how to run the project locally without workspace helpers.

## Where to use the flavor

- Internal flavor and lore files under `GHOSTWIRE_GPT/` (for example the flavor and theme docs) are the canonical places to use the Neon Oracle persona, evocative metaphors, and aesthetic emoji.

- UI skinning or demo interfaces may use decorative language and icons when the audience is explicitly internal or demonstrational.

## Where to avoid the flavor

- Public-facing documentation such as API reference, legal text, error messages, and CLI help should use a neutral, professional tone.

- Tests, logs consumed by CI or log aggregation systems, and user-facing error messages must remain machine-parseable and clear.

## Emoji / ANSI / metaphor opt-out

If you'd like to disable decorative output (emoji, ANSI color sequences, or playful metaphors) for CI or plain logs, set the environment variable:

```bash
GHOSTWIRE_NO_EMOJI=1
```

This is a recommended example. The repo's docs and OpenSpec proposals reference this env var as a suggested convention; if you want the runtime behavior wired to this var, see the `implement-logging-optout` change or open a small PR to add handling in the logging initialization.

## Quick run instructions (no `uv` required)

If you don't use the `uv` workspace helper, the easiest local workflow is:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
PYTHONPATH=python uv run python -m python.ghostwire.main
```

On macOS/zsh you can replace `.venv/bin/` with `.venv/bin/` as above. If the project already provides a `.env` file, ensure it contains appropriate values for `DB_PATH` and other settings.

Thanks for contributing â€” keep the neon for the right places, and keep public interfaces clean.

## Docs linting

We enforce markdown linting with `markdownlint-cli2` via a pre-commit hook. The pre-commit configuration is
self-contained and will automatically install the `markdownlint-cli2` binary for the hook, so contributors
do not need to install it globally. If you prefer to run the linter manually, you can still use npm/npx:

```bash

# optional: install locally
npm install --save-dev markdownlint-cli2

# or run via npx without installing
npx markdownlint-cli2 .
```

If you use the repository `uv` workspace helper, you can run the npm command via `uv run` if you prefer.

## Editor configuration

We keep a project-wide `.editorconfig` to ensure consistent formatting across editors and platforms.
Quick summary of the preferences in this repo:

- Python: 4 spaces, UTF-8, trim trailing whitespace, ensure final newline
- Markdown: 2 spaces, preserve trailing whitespace (some docs intentionally include it)
- YAML: 2 spaces, preserve trailing whitespace
- JS/JSON/CSS/TS: 2 spaces, trim trailing whitespace
- Makefile: tabs for indentation (Make requires tabs)

Install an EditorConfig plugin for your editor (most editors support this) and run `pre-commit install` to enable automatic hooks locally. Pre-commit will apply many formatting fixes automatically.
