Decisions:

- Provide a simple CLI that accepts a file or directory and an optional `--dry-run` flag.
- Reuse existing embedding service code where possible; fall back to an environment-configured local embedder.
- Chunking: default to 500 token/word chunks with overlap; configurable via CLI flags.

Security & Safety:

- Do not overwrite DB schema; insert only.
- Provide a `--confirm` flag for destructive actions (not used by default).
