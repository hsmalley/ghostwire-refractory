# Formatting and Linting Standards Specification

## Purpose

The Formatting and Linting capability ensures consistent code quality, style, and maintainability across the GhostWire Refractory project through automated formatting and linting tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Code Formatting Standards

The project SHALL maintain consistent code formatting across all supported languages.

#### Scenario: Python Code Formatting

- **WHEN** Python code is formatted
- **THEN** it follows the style enforced by Black or Ruff with 88 character line length

#### Scenario: Markdown Formatting

- **WHEN** Markdown files are formatted
- **THEN** they follow consistent formatting standards with proper structure

#### Scenario: JavaScript/TypeScript Formatting

- **WHEN** frontend JavaScript/TypeScript code is formatted
- **THEN** it follows consistent style guidelines (Prettier if applicable)

### Requirement: Linting and Static Analysis

The project SHALL enforce code quality through automated linting tools.

#### Scenario: Python Linting

- **WHEN** Python code is linted
- **THEN** Ruff identifies and enforces code quality rules based on selected rule sets

#### Scenario: Markdown Linting

- **WHEN** Markdown files are linted
- **THEN** markdownlint-cli2 identifies and enforces markdown quality standards

#### Scenario: Type Checking (if applicable)

- **WHEN** Python code undergoes type checking
- **THEN** MyPy verifies type consistency and correctness

### Requirement: Automated Enforcement

Code formatting and linting SHALL be enforced automatically in the development workflow.

#### Scenario: Pre-commit Hook Integration

- **WHEN** developers commit code
- **THEN** pre-commit hooks automatically format and lint code before allowing the commit

#### Scenario: CI/CD Integration

- **WHEN** code changes are submitted to CI
- **THEN** the build pipeline validates formatting and linting standards

### Requirement: Configuration Management

The project SHALL maintain consistent linting and formatting configurations.

#### Scenario: Shared Configuration Files

- **WHEN** developers set up their environment
- **THEN** they can access shared configuration files for all linting tools

#### Scenario: Configuration Updates

- **WHEN** linting standards are updated
- **THEN** the changes apply consistently across the codebase

## Implementation Constraints

### Tool Selection

- Python formatting: Ruff or Black recommended as primary tool
- Python linting: Ruff recommended as primary linter
- Markdown linting: markdownlint-cli2 for documentation files
- Configuration: Standard configuration files (pyproject.toml, .markdownlint.json, etc.)

### Performance

- Linting operations SHOULD complete quickly to not impede development workflow
- Formatting operations SHOULD be fast enough for pre-commit hook usage
- CI checks SHOULD not significantly increase build times

### Consistency

- All tools SHOULD enforce consistent styling across the entire codebase
- Configuration SHOULD align with industry best practices
- Enforcement SHOULD be consistent across all development environments

## Design Principles

### Automation-First

Formatting and linting should be handled automatically rather than manually enforced.

### Developer Experience

Tools should enhance rather than impede the development workflow.

### Consistency

Code style should be uniform across the entire project regardless of author.

### Quality Assurance

Linting should catch issues early in the development process.

### Minimal Configuration

Standards should require minimal custom configuration to reduce maintenance overhead.
