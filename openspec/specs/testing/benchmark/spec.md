# Spec: Benchmark Testing Framework

## Purpose
The Benchmark Testing Framework capability measures performance metrics for the GhostWire Refractory system using the GHOSTWIRE scoring system. These tests evaluate system performance across multiple dimensions including latency, stability, memory usage, and quality to provide quantitative assessments of system improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Structure
Benchmark tests SHALL follow a clear structure using pytest conventions with appropriate markers.

#### Scenario: Test File Structure
- **WHEN** creating a new benchmark test file
- **THEN** it follows the `test_<module>.py` naming convention and is placed in `python/tests/benchmark/`

#### Scenario: Test Class Structure
- **WHEN** organizing benchmark tests in classes
- **THEN** they use the `Test<ClassName>` naming convention and may inherit from `unittest.TestCase` or use pytest fixtures

#### Scenario: Test Method Structure
- **WHEN** writing benchmark test methods
- **THEN** they use the `test_<functionality>` naming convention and follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

#### Scenario: Test Marker Usage
- **WHEN** running benchmark tests
- **THEN** they are marked with `@pytest.mark.benchmark` for proper categorization

### Requirement: GHOSTWIRE Scoring System Integration
Benchmark tests SHALL integrate with the GHOSTWIRE scoring system for quantitative performance assessment.

#### Scenario: Latency Measurement
- **WHEN** measuring operation performance
- **THEN** they record execution time and contribute to GHOSTWIRE latency scores

#### Scenario: Stability Measurement
- **WHEN** evaluating result consistency
- **THEN** they measure embedding similarity and contribute to GHOSTWIRE stability scores

#### Scenario: Memory Usage Measurement
- **WHEN** monitoring resource consumption
- **THEN** they track memory usage and contribute to GHOSTWIRE memory scores

#### Scenario: Quality Measurement
- **WHEN** assessing output quality
- **THEN** they evaluate result relevance and contribute to GHOSTWIRE quality scores

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Performance
Benchmark tests SHALL provide meaningful performance measurements.

#### Scenario: Accurate Timing
- **WHEN** measuring operation durations
- **THEN** they use high-resolution timers for precision

#### Scenario: Statistical Significance
- **WHEN** reporting performance metrics
- **THEN** they aggregate multiple measurements for statistical validity

#### Scenario: Resource Monitoring
- **WHEN** measuring resource consumption
- **THEN** they track CPU, memory, and I/O usage accurately

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Coverage
Benchmark tests SHALL comprehensively evaluate system performance across core capabilities.

#### Scenario: Embedding Performance
- **WHEN** benchmarking embedding generation
- **THEN** they measure vector creation latency and quality

#### Scenario: RAG Performance
- **WHEN** benchmarking RAG operations
- **THEN** they measure retrieval accuracy and response time

#### Scenario: Summarization Performance
- **WHEN** benchmarking summarization
- **THEN** they measure compression ratios and coherence

#### Scenario: Model Comparison
- **WHEN** comparing different models
- **THEN** they provide quantitative performance differences

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Reporting
Benchmark tests SHALL produce detailed, actionable performance reports.

#### Scenario: Performance Metrics
- **WHEN** completing benchmark runs
- **THEN** they output structured performance data in JSON format

#### Scenario: GHOSTWIRE Scores
- **WHEN** calculating composite scores
- **THEN** they apply the GHOSTWIRE scoring formula consistently

#### Scenario: Trend Analysis
- **WHEN** comparing results over time
- **THEN** they enable performance trend visualization

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Configuration
Benchmark tests SHALL be configurable and environment-aware.

#### Scenario: Model Configuration
- **WHEN** running benchmarks with different models
- **THEN** they respect `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL` and other model configuration settings

#### Scenario: Database Configuration
- **WHEN** running benchmarks with databases
- **THEN** they respect `DB_PATH` and other database configuration settings

#### Scenario: Environment Variable Support
- **WHEN** benchmark tests access configuration
- **THEN** they respect environment variables and .env files

### Requirement: Benchmark Test Reproducibility
Benchmark tests SHALL produce consistent, reproducible results.

#### Scenario: Random Seed Management
- **WHEN** running benchmarks with random data
- **THEN** they use fixed seeds for reproducible results

#### Scenario: Environment Isolation
- **WHEN** running benchmarks in different environments
- **THEN** they produce comparable results

#### Scenario: Version Tracking
- **WHEN** recording benchmark results
- **THEN** they include version information for result attribution

## Design Principles

### Quantitative
Benchmarks SHOULD produce numerical results that can be compared over time.

### Representative
Benchmarks SHOULD reflect real-world usage patterns and scenarios.

### Actionable
Benchmarks SHOULD identify specific areas for performance improvement.

### Repeatable
Benchmarks SHOULD produce consistent results when run multiple times.

### Scalable
Benchmarks SHOULD be able to run with varying load levels.

### Comprehensive
Benchmarks SHOULD cover all major system components and operations.

### ðŸ’€ Rule of Cool
Benchmarks SHOULD be visually appealing and thematically consistent with the GhostWire aesthetic. Use cyberpunk-inspired variable names and descriptive language that makes performance data feel like part of the GhostWire universe. When reporting scores, make them feel like ritual measurements rather than dry numbers.
