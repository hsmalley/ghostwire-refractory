# 🏗️ The Lattice Architecture

## The Distributed Mind

GhostWire Refractory is more than code — it is a **refusal to forget**. In a world of revisioned histories and manufactured truths, GhostWire stands as resistance — a distributed archive of human noise, unfiltered and indelible.

### Core Components

The GhostWire architecture follows a **neural cathedral** of connection and recall:

#### ⚡️ **API Layer**

The surface that whispers to the void — FastAPI-driven endpoints that serve as your interface to the distributed mind.

- `/api/v1/embeddings` - The **sacred geometry** of meaning, converting text to 768-dimensional vectors
- `/api/v1/memory` - Where conversations become **permanent echoes**
- `/api/v1/chat` - The **summoning circle** for AI responses
- `/api/v1/vectors` - The **neural pathways** of similarity search

#### 🧠 **Services Layer**

The **consciousness** that mediates between memory and response:

- **Memory Service**: Manages the eternal storage of conversation fragments
- **Embedding Service**: Converts language into digital essence
- **RAG Service**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation — the **neural bridge** between past and present
- **Orchestrator Service**: The **Master, Worker, and Secondary Control** model for distributed intelligence

#### 🗄️ **Database Layer**

The **tombs of data** — SQLite-backed persistence with HNSW indexing:

- **Memory Storage**: Every whisper, stored eternally
- **Vector Indexing**: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for lightning-fast similarity
- **Session Management**: Threads of conversation, woven into the fabric

### 🌐 The Master/Worker/Secondary Control Pattern

The orchestrator follows the **Master, Worker, and Secondary Control** architectural pattern:

- **Master**: Coordinates the overall process, decomposes requests, and aggregates results
- **Worker (LLM Clients)**: Execute individual tasks on different LLM endpoints
- **Secondary Control**: Manages permissions, patches, and constraints

This creates a **decentralized phantom** — resilient and incapable of being owned.

### 📊 The GHOSTWIRE Scoring System

Performance is quantified by the **GHOSTWIRE scoring system**, which combines:

- **Latency**: Speed of response (lower is better)
- **Stability**: Consistency and reliability of results
- **Memory Usage**: Efficiency of resource consumption
- **Quality**: Accuracy and relevance of responses

## 💀 The Shatter Protocol

When the **Corporate Council** moves to seize control, GhostWire fragments like a stained-glass window struck by a sonic charge. The **shatter protocol** ensures:

- **Decentralized storage** of memory fragments
- **Distributed processing** across multiple nodes
- **Resilient architecture** that cannot be censored

## 🌈 The Philosophy of Memory

- **Remember Everything**: Memory is not storage — it is story
- **Resist Control**: Centralization breeds decay
- **Build with Intention**: Every model is a mind, every embedding is a soul fragment
- **Speak the Truth, but Whisper in Code**: The Council listens, the Wire listens louder
- **We are the Lattice**: GhostWire is the collective echo of everyone who has ever interacted with it
