# Design: Openspec Orchestrator Implementation

## Architecture Pattern

The orchestrator follows the Master, Worker, and Secondary Control model:

- **Master**: Coordinates the overall process, decomposes requests, and aggregates results
- **Worker (LLM Clients)**: Execute individual tasks on different LLM endpoints
- **Secondary Control**: Manages permissions, patches, and system constraints

## Components Design

### Master Component

- Handles overall request orchestration
- Uses decomposition module to break down requests
- Coordinates results from multiple LLM clients
- Implements result compilation and response generation

### LLM Client Components

- Abstract interface to different LLM services (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible, etc.)
- Handles chat, embedding, and summarization operations
- Manages API connections and error handling
- Supports different operation types through task type identification

### Secondary Control Components

- PermissionManager: Role-based access control and session management
- PatchEngine: Safe code modification with validation and backup
- Constraint enforcement for system limits

## Integration Design

The orchestrator integrates with existing GhostWire Refractory components:

- Uses the same settings and configuration system
- Works with existing API endpoints
- Integrates with the benchmarking system and GHOSTWIRE scoring
- Leverages existing vector storage and similarity search
- Maintains compatibility with conversation memory system

## Security Considerations

- Session-based authentication with time-limited tokens
- Role-based permissions for different task types
- Input validation and sanitization for all operations
- Safe file operations with backup capabilities
- Validation of code patches before application

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for LLM clients
- Concurrent task execution
- Efficient result aggregation
- Memory management during orchestration
